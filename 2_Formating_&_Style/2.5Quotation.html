        In recent years, Bangladesh witnessed an increased rise of intolerance that has plagued its society and minorities are increasingly subject to violent attacks by Muslims. Making things worse, the digital security act (DSA) which was enforced by the government to curtail disinformation is now used by Islamists as a Blasphemy law subjugating minority communities in the country. HRCBM has investigated 100 false cases in which victims are charged on the false pretext of blasphemy under the DSA. This misuse of law and continual attacks by Muslims is threatening the existence of minorities in Bangladesh. In the last few years, more than 4000 attacks took place against the countryâ€™s dwindling minorities but the government has yet to take any punitive action against criminals. Situation of Bangladeshi Minorities is very alarming.
